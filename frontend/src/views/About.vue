    <h1>Welcome to the page that will tell you more about the group members and the application we designed!</h1>
    <h3> This application was designed by Matthew Hayward, Simon Benzer, Andrew Denman and Kundana Narla</h3>
    <h4> The main purpose of the application is to be able to take a database filled with many different data points
      and be able to visualize them in one of several different data visualizations. You will also be able to 
      export any visualization you choose, as well as being able to implement any changes to the data that you 
      feel necessary. Another major feature is the ability to alter and search for existing parts in our database 
      you will need to leave a comment if you wish to make changes detailing what you changed or altered. In addition, we 
      have a map of all of our existing polls that will highlight the various outputs from each poll that is being used in 
      the database.
